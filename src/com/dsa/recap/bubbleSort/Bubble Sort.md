# Learn Bubble Sort in 7 minutes(03-04-2024):
i) Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm.
ii) It is efficient for small data set
iii) But it is not efficient for larger data set
### Sorting Logic:
It compares two adjacent elements, if they are in order it remains same and then compares the next adjacent pairs of elements, if they are not in order then they swap. And continues the process at last of the index.
### Time Complexity:
O(n^2)-Quadratic time. Donâ€™t use it for a large data set.
The more data increases the more it becomes inefficient.
[But it is good for study purpose]
