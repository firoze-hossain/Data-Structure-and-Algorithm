### Process:
It starts from index 1.  Then the value from index one moves into a temp variable and it compares values which are in left and if it is greater the temp then it is shifted to right.
### Time Complexity:
O(n^2)-Quadratic Time
### Advantages:
i) It is good for small data set
ii) But not good for large data set
iii) It takes less steps than bubble sort
iv) Sometimes it works linearly O(n) compares to selection sort O(n^2)
