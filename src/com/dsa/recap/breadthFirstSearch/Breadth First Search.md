### Difference Between Breadth and Depth first search:
#### Breadth First Search:
i) It is done one level at a time
ii) It uses queue data structure
iii)It is better if the destination is on average close to start
iv)Siblings are visited before children
#### Depth First Search:
i)It is done one branch at a time
ii) Utilises stack data structure
iii)It is better to use if the destination is on average far to start
iv)Children are visited before siblings
v) Most uses in games and puzzles
