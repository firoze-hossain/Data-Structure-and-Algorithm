# Merge Sort(10-04-2024):
1) Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm.
2) It divides the array always into two when we call a recursive merge sort function. It will be stopped when the array size becomes 1.

3) Then after dividing into one element it merges and sorting element and returns back to the main array.
### Runtime complexity:
O(nlogn)- Quasilinear time
### Space Complexity:
O(n)
### Advantages:
i) It is faster than bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort. But space complexity is less than merge sort.
ii) It is efficient for large data set than bubble,insertion, selection sort
