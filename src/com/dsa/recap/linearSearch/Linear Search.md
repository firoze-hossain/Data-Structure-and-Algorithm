# Learn Linear Search in 3 minutes(31-03-2024):
Linear Search is a searching algorithm that iterate through the list for one element at a time
### Time Complexity :
O(n)-Linear time- Proportional of steps.
### Disadvantage:
i) It is not efficient for big data set
### Advantages:
i)It is efficient for small to medium data set
ii)It is not necessary to be sorted the elements
iii) Which is not necessary for random data access linear search is best for them. For LinkedList it is good.
