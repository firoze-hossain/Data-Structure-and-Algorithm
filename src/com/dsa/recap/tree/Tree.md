# Tree(03-05-2024):<br>
A Tree is a non-linear data structure in which nodes are organised in a hierarchy.<br>
### Example:<br>
Where Tree Data Structure is used<br>
i) File explorer<br>
ii) Databases<br>
iii)DNS(Domain Name Server)<br>
iv)HTML DOM(HTML Document Object Model)<br>
### Some Key Terminology:<br>
i) Root Node(Parent Node): It has only outgoing edges, no incoming edges.<br>
ii) Branch Node: It has incoming and outgoing edges.<br>
iii) Leaf Node: It has only incoming edges<br>
**Edge**: The relationship between two nodes.<br>
**Node**: We call it data.<br>
**Depth Of Node**: The number of edges from root node to that node.<br>
**Height Of Node**: THe number of edges from leaf node to the root node, If leaf node are in same distance.<br>
