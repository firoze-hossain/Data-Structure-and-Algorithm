### Binary Tree:<br>
A Binary Tree is a tree where each node has no more than two children. The children could be one , but no more than two.<br>
### Binary Search Tree:<br>
A Binary Search tree is a tree where each node organises in a certain order. The root node is greater than the left child, but smaller than the right child. It is because to look up quickly. From the root node, the leftmost child is the least value and the rightmost child is the largest value.<br>
### Complexity:<br>
**Best case scenario**: O(logn)<br>
**Worst case scenario**: O(n)<br>
